Not investment advice.**\n\n**DeFi Protocol Analysis:**\n\n**Protocol Type:** Automated Market Maker (AMM)\n- Decentralized exchange using liquidity pools\n- Examples: Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap\n\n**Metrics:**\n- TVL (Total Value Locked): $500M = Medium-sized protocol\n- APY: 15% for LPs = Attractive, but not suspiciously high\n\n**Risk Analysis:**\n\n**1. Smart Contract Risk:**\n- ❌ No audit = CRITICAL RED FLAG\n- Unaudited code = high exploit risk\n- Recent hacks: $2B+ lost to unaudited protocols\n\n**2. Impermanent Loss:**\n- Occurs when token prices diverge\n- Can exceed trading fees earned\n- Higher volatility = higher IL risk\n- 15% APY may not cover IL for volatile pairs\n\n**3. Liquidity Risk:**\n- $500M TVL = decent, but can drain quickly\n- Check liquidity depth before large trades\n\n**4. Regulatory Risk:**\n- DeFi faces increasing regulatory scrutiny\n- Protocol could be forced to shut down\n\n**Educational Risk Assessment:**\n- Smart Contract Risk: 🔴 CRITICAL (no audit)\n- Impermanent Loss: 🟡 MEDIUM\n- Liquidity Risk: 🟢 LOW (adequate TVL)\n- Regulatory Risk: 🟡 MEDIUM\n\n**Recommendation (Educational):**\n❌ AVOID until audited by reputable firm (Trail of Bits, ConsenSys, OpenZeppelin)\n\n15% APY not worth smart contract risk.", "tags": ["crypto_dataset", "cryptocurrency_analysis"], "quality_score": 0.7, "metadata": {"legacy_domain": "crypto", "source_file": null}}
