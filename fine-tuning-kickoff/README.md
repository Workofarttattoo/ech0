# ECH0 Fine-Tuning Kickoff

This folder captures the actionable punch list for the first two weeks of the multi-domain training program plus the Vertex AI dry-run. Use these docs alongside `ECH0_MULTI_DOMAIN_TRAINING_MASTER_PLAN.md`.

## Contents
- `week1_infra.md` – GCP storage, dependency installs, API connectivity tests.
- `week2_data_downloads.md` – Rolling ingestion schedule + commands.
- `vertex_dry_run.md` – Vertex AI environment staging and smoke fine-tune checklist.

Follow the order below:
1. Complete the Week 1 infra checklist and paste the captured API test logs into `ech0_training_logs/infra/`.
2. Keep Week 2 downloads running continuously; update the tracker table each day.
3. After storage + datasets are verified, run the Vertex dry-run to confirm credentials and LoRA config.
